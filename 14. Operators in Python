To perform operations on variables or values we have to use operators in Python.
 

Arithmetic Operators:
+: Addition
-: Subtraction
*: Multiplication
/: Division (float result)
//: Floor Division (integer result)
%: Modulus (remainder)
**: Exponentiation (power)


Assignment Operators:
=: Assigns a value to a variable.
+=: Adds a value to the variable and assigns the result.
`-=``: Subtracts a value from the variable and assigns the result.
`*=``: Multiplies the variable by a value and assigns the result.
`/=``: Divides the variable by a value and assigns the result.
`//=``: Performs floor division on the variable and assigns the result.
`%=``: Performs modulus on the variable and assigns the result.
`**=``: Performs exponentiation on the variable and assigns the result.


Comparison Operators:
==: Equal to
!=: Not equal to
<: Less than
>: Greater than
<=: Less than or equal to
>=: Greater than or equal to


Logical Operators:
and: Logical AND
or: Logical OR
not: Logical NOT


Bitwise Operators:
&: Bitwise AND
|: Bitwise OR
^: Bitwise XOR
~: Bitwise NOT
<<: Left shift
>>: Right shift


Membership Operators:
in: Returns True if a value is present in a sequence.
not in: Returns True if a value is not present in a sequence.


Identity Operators:
is: Returns True if two variables refer to the same object.
is not: Returns True if two variables refer to different objects.
