Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

=: Simple assignment operator. Assigns the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.
Example:
x = 10

+=: Add and assign operator. Adds the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side and assigns the result to the variable.
Example:
x += 5  # Equivalent to x = x + 5

-=: Subtract and assign operator. Subtracts the value on the right-hand side from the variable on the left-hand side and assigns the result to the variable.
Example:
x -= 3  # Equivalent to x = x â€“ 3

*=: Multiply and assign operator. Multiplies the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result to the variable.
Example:
x *= 2  # Equivalent to x = x * 2

/=: Divide and assign operator. Divides the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result to the variable.
Example:
x /= 4  # Equivalent to x = x / 4

//=: Floor division and assign operator. Performs floor division on the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result to the variable.
Example:
x //= 3  # Equivalent to x = x // 3

%=: Modulo and assign operator. Performs the modulo operation on the variable on the left-hand side with the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result to the variable.
Example:
x %= 7  # Equivalent to x = x % 7

**=: Exponentiation and assign operator. Raises the variable on the left-hand side to the power of the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result to the variable.
Example:
x **= 2  # Equivalent to x = x ** 2
