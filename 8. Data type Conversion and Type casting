In Python, data type conversion is the process of converting one data type to another. Python supports several data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. 
Sometimes, you may need to convert one data type to another for various reasons such as performing arithmetic operations or storing data in a specific format.

Type casting, on the other hand, is a method of explicitly converting a value from one data type to another. In Python, you can use various built-in functions and methods to convert data types.

Here are some examples of data type conversion and type casting in Python:


Convert string to integer:
str_num = "10"
int_num = int(str_num)
print(int_num)  # Output: 10


Convert integer to float:
int_num = 10
float_num = float(int_num)
print(float_num)  # Output: 10.0


Convert float to integer:
float_num = 10.5
int_num = int(float_num)
print(int_num)  # Output: 10


Convert string to float:
str_num = "10.5"
float_num = float(str_num)
print(float_num)  # Output: 10.5


Type casting in arithmetic operations:
num1 = 10
num2 = 2
result = num1 / num2
print(result)  # Output: 5.0 (float)

int_result = int(result)
print(int_result)  # Output: 5 (integer)
