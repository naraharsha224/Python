In Python, a string is a sequence of characters, enclosed in quotes. Python supports two types of quotes for defining strings: single quotes ('...') and double quotes ("...").

Here are some examples of defining strings in Python:

# using single quotes
string1 = 'Hello, world!'

# using double quotes
string2 = "This is a string."

# using triple quotes for multi-line strings
string3 = """This is a
multi-line string."""

# using escape characters
string4 = "She said, \"I'm tired.\""


In Python, strings are immutable, which means you cannot change a string once it is created. However, you can create a new string by concatenating two or more strings using the + operator or by repeating a string using the * operator.

Here are some examples of string operations in Python:
# concatenation
string1 = 'Hello, '
string2 = 'world!'
string3 = string1 + string2
print(string3)  # output: Hello, world!

# repetition
string4 = 'Na' * 4 + ' Batman!'
print(string4)  # output: NaNaNaNa Batman!


Python provides a rich set of built-in string methods that you can use to manipulate strings. 
Here are some examples:
# upper and lower case
string = 'Hello, World!'
print(string.upper())  # output: HELLO, WORLD!
print(string.lower())  # output: hello, world!

# split and join
words = string.split()  # split the string into a list of words
print(words)  # output: ['Hello,', 'World!']
new_string = ' '.join(words)  # join the list of words with a space
print(new_string)  # output: Hello, World!

# strip and replace
string = '  Hello, World!  '
print(string.strip())  # output: Hello, World!
new_string = string.replace('World', 'Python')
print(new_string)  # output:   Hello, Python!
